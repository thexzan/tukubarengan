The problem with that is they only started backing it all up in January at CES, when we finally&nbsp;got a look at&nbsp;&mdash; and more importantly, a&nbsp;ride in&nbsp;&mdash; the FF91, the mass-market electric vehicle Faraday plans to build. That car now has a new test ahead of it that will take place in the public eye, because Faraday has entered the FF91 in this year&rsquo;s Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p id=\"vdBWZw\">The Hill Climb takes place in June, and it&rsquo;s a 101-year-old competition where drivers race their cars through 156 turns and 12.42 miles in an attempt to set the fastest time &mdash; all while climbing nearly a mile to the 14,115-foot summit. The FF91 will be driven by&nbsp;British GT Championship&nbsp;driver Robin Shute.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload//FF91_Iceland_02.0_.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p id=\"UjWqQf\">Faraday will compete in the &ldquo;exhibition class,&rdquo; which the Hill Climb organizers explain as a way to &ldquo;demonstrate advancements in the practical application of motor sports technology.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s essentially a class for cars that don&rsquo;t meet the requirements for the more competitive divisions, but it still allows entrants to record an official climb time. But there&rsquo;s a fun wrinkle here, too &mdash; there&rsquo;s a Tesla Model S P100D entered in the same class, and it will be driven by Formula Drift champion Dai Yoshihara.</p>\r\n<p id=\"m_5205142253386259117AppleMailSignature\">A spokesperson for Faraday tells&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>&nbsp;that the company is bringing the FF91 to Pikes Peak &ldquo;to further facilitate our internal engineering development&rdquo; of the car. &ldquo;We continue to improve the powertrain we are preparing for our car, and Pikes Peak offers a demanding environment in which we can evaluate it,&rdquo; they write. Faraday will use a &ldquo;beta level development car&rdquo; like the one shown off at CES.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p id=\"oqt9bn\">The FF91 is supposed to go into production in 2018, though the company has spent the better part of the last year dealing with&nbsp;serious financial turmoil&nbsp;that spurred resignations, debts, and major hiccups in the process of&nbsp;building its $1 billion factory&nbsp;in Nevada.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload//FF91_VAlgorithmicWall_00005.0_.jpg\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p id=\"CBrAJf\">Faraday Future has had connections to motorsports since the company came out of stealth mode. The company is partnered up with one of the teams in the&nbsp;all-electric racing series Formula E, and it unveiled a&nbsp;racey (but static) concept car&nbsp;at last year&rsquo;s CES. So Pikes Peak isn&rsquo;t that much of a reach. But it&rsquo;s also not like Faraday is going to disrupt anything as it rolls up the hill. Electric cars have been competing in the Hill Climb for a few years now, and they&rsquo;re already pretty dominant since their performance isn&rsquo;t affected by a change in altitude.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p id=\"KGXqSj\">Both before and after its announcement, Faraday Future couldn&rsquo;t help but surround the FF91 with smoke and mirrors. But heavily edited clips of the car beating its contemporaries in a drag race and carefully controlled events at CES only go so far when it comes to speaking to the FF91&rsquo;s actual performance. Who knew the first chance we&rsquo;d get to see the FF91 perform on even ground would be in a race up a hill?</p>','ff91.jpg','2017-05-25 17:44:28'),

It is undisputed that the moon&rsquo;s gravitational pull controls the tides, and thus exerts a real influence on the earth and our lives. On the moon phase display of the Portugieser Perpetual Calendar with a double moon or a single moon, the moon is just 5 millimetres in diameter. Nevertheless, the depiction of its orbit on the miniature stage diverges by just 1 day in 577.5 years from the actual phase of the moon. In the model with the double moon display, the moon phase and its mirror image show the state of the moon in both the northern and southern hemispheres.

For the first time ever, the double-moon model comes with the railway-track chapter ring typical of the Portugieser, while the designers have transformed the entire moon phase display into a star-studded night sky, so that the moon and stars appear to hover in infinite space. Both models are equipped with IWC-manufactured movements from the new IWC 52000-calibre family, featuring solid red gold rotors and blued screws. Each watch also has ergonomically optimized strap horns, an arched-edge front glass and a luxurious Santoni strap. Otherwise, the modern and elegant time machines leave virtually no wish unfulfilled: perpetual calendar, window showing the year in four digits, 7-day automatic movement with Pellaton winding and a power reserve display.</p>\r\n</div>','iwc.jpg','2017-05-25 17:59:56'),

We like to think that DJI calls it the Inspire 2 because it has two (or more) of everything.</p>\r\n<p>Arguably the biggest inclusion is a dual battery setup, which gives the Inspire 2 a number of key benefits. Not only does it give the bird more flight time &mdash; it also protects it from battery malfunctions, and, more importantly, provides ample power for ancillary systems like cameras, stabilizers, sensors, and processors.</p>\r\n<p>We like to think that DJI calls it the Inspire 2 because it has two (or more) of everything.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of cameras, not only does this drone rock a detachable and easily upgradable Zenmuse cam (ours came with the new X5S), it also sports a forward-facing FPV camera, which allows the pilot to keep an eye on what&rsquo;s ahead of the drone while simultaneously watching/controlling the Zenmuse camera.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also equipped with dual inertial motion sensors, dual barometers, and dedicated processors for various subsystems &mdash; including the newly-added obstacle avoidance sensors. Hell, you can even fly it with two controllers. Together, these new additions serve to make the Inspire 2 far more reliable, stable, and safe to fly than any previous iteration.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload/fg.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Build quality and design</strong></p>\r\n<p>In terms of form, the Inspire 2 isn&rsquo;t really a huge departure from the original model. It sports the same prop configuration, the same retractable landing gear system, and more or less the same body style. There are, however, a few small design upgrades that make the Inspire 2 more versatile and capable than its predecessors &mdash; despite the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t look much different.</p>\r\n<p>The most notable and noticeable design change is undoubtedly the Inspire&rsquo;s new forward-facing FPV camera and obstacle-avoidance system. Both systems live in a nose-mounted sensor bar, which contains a small optical lens and two laser rangefinders. Aesthetically, it&rsquo;s a fairly minor change &mdash; but in terms of functionality, these systems provide a huge benefit. Obstacle avoidance gives the drone the ability to autonomously prevent crashes, while the FPV camera allows the pilot (or pilots) to keep track of the Inspire&rsquo;s heading, regardless of where the Zenmuse X5S might be facing.</p>\r\n<p>Build quality is, as we&rsquo;ve come to expect from DJI, off the charts. Even for a DJI drone, the Inspire 2 is ridiculously well built. The props feature a new locking system that ensures they&rsquo;ll never come loose during flight, while the prop arms are made of the same super-strong carbon-fiber tubing that previous generations have. If this drone crashes (which is unlikely), the only components that&rsquo;d likely suffer serious damage are the props and the camera. This thing is basically a flying tank.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, the design is a victory. Instead of a massive overhaul, DJI took a winning formula and made a few small improvements &mdash; which we appreciate. It&rsquo;s like trading in your car for a new model year: same look and feel, but with a few extra bells and whistles that make the driving experience completely different.</p>\r\n<h3>Battery life and recharge time</h3>\r\n<p>Battery life is hugely improved in the new Inspire. Whereas the original and Pro versions averaged about 15 minutes per charge, the Inspire 2 is rated for 27 minutes of flight time. In a simple hover test, we got just over 25 minutes of flight time before the drone went into emergency landing mode &mdash; but of course, that&rsquo;s not really a good reflection of real-world use. During our normal flight tests, where we flew around and made use of the drone&rsquo;s many subsystems, we averaged about 23 minutes of flight time. Like any other drone, if you use features that require more processing power (obstacle avoidance, Active Track, etc.), then you can expect to see a corresponding drop in flight longevity.</p>\r\n<p>As for recharge time, you can expect about an hour on the charger before your battery reaches capacity. After our hover test (which ran the battery down to 10 percent and prompted DJI&rsquo;s automated emergency landing sequence), the battery took about an hour and 20 minutes to charge up to 100 percent &mdash; but in most cases, you won&rsquo;t be draining the batteries that much. If you do what most people do and land shortly after the first &ldquo;low power warning&rdquo; pops up, you&rsquo;ll end up with roughly an hour on the power dock to recharge.</p>\r\n<p>Hour-long recharge times aren&rsquo;t particularly special &mdash; but one thing we do appreciate is DJI&rsquo;s new charger dock. It&rsquo;s designed to accommodate up to four batteries at once &mdash; and charge them all simultaneously. If your batteries are not paired, the hub will intelligently charge the cells according to power levels from high to low. If your batteries <em>are</em> paired, the pair with more stored power will charge first &mdash; which means you&rsquo;ll get back into the air faster and spend less time waiting for your batteries to juice up.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload/c.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Flight performance and autonomy</h3>\r\n<p>In the air, the Inspire 2 is a beast. It&rsquo;s big, burly, outrageously stable, and more reliable than any drone we&rsquo;ve ever flown. Despite the fact that it&rsquo;s quite a bit heavier than its smaller brethren, the Phantom and Mavic Pro, it&rsquo;s every bit as quick and nimble. Acceleration is a bit slower due to the bird&rsquo;s extra weight and inertia &mdash; but once it gets up to speed, it leaves everything else in the proverbial dust.</p>\r\n<p>DJI rates the Inspire 2 with a top speed of 58 miles per hour, but with a good tailwind you can easily get it up to 60 or higher. This is especially useful when you&rsquo;re filming something that moves quickly &mdash; like a car, for example. We took it along for one of our car review video shoots (check out the video up top), and the drone didn&rsquo;t have any trouble keeping pace as we zipped around corners and blasted down straightaways. That being said, if you need to use the Inspire&rsquo;s obstacle avoidance abilities, you&rsquo;ll be limited to a top speed of 45 miles per hour. Still, that&rsquo;s pretty quick for sensor-aided flight.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of which, the Inspire boasts a slew of smart piloting features. In addition to DJI&rsquo;s standard suite of Intelligent Flight modes (TapFly, Waypoint, Point of Interest, Active Track, etc), the Inspire 2 is also equipped with DJI&rsquo;s new Spotlight Pro mode &mdash; which is immensely useful for filming moving objects.</p>\r\n<p>Spotlight Pro uses DJI&rsquo;s visual tracking algorithms to lock onto a subject during flight, regardless of the direction that the Inspire 2 flies &mdash; thereby enabling a single pilot to capture shots that would otherwise require a dedicated camera operator. If the gimbal comes close to reaching its rotation limits, the Inspire 2 itself will rotate in the same direction without affecting flight control &ndash;or the shot being captured&ndash; to free up gimbal movement. In other words, you can literally fly circles around a moving subject and the camera will stay trained on it regardless of how the drone rotates.</p>\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s really just the beginning. Thanks to all the sensors and processing power packed into the Inspire 2, the drone can basically fly itself. That&rsquo;s not just a figure of speech, either &mdash; it legitimately happened during our testing process.</p>\r\n<p>During my first car-filming excursion, something went horribly wrong. Toward the end of the flight (which ultimately carried me about two miles away from the takeoff point), the Inspire&rsquo;s battery levels hit 30 percent. Because the drone was still on its factory default settings, this caused the Inspire to initiate its &ldquo;automatic return to home&rdquo; function.</p>\r\n<p>The drone can basically fly itself. That&rsquo;s not just a figure of speech, either.</p>\r\n<p>Normally, this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem &ndash; you can halt it with the flick of a switch in the app. But unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t get that opportunity. At almost the exact moment that the Inspire stopped and turned to head back, my phone rang. The &ldquo;you&rsquo;re getting a call&rdquo; screen popped up over the DJI Go app &nbsp;(Android | iOS), I panicked, and by the time I was done fumbling with my phone, the drone had already flown out of range &mdash; straight into a thicket of trees and wetland swamps.</p>\r\n<p>For the first minute, I was in a state of sheer panic. I thought I had just lost a $6,000 drone, and was already dreading the call I&rsquo;d have to make to DJI. But then I remembered that the Inspire 2 isn&rsquo;t your average drone. It has advanced GPS, obstacle avoidance, and a slew of environmental sensors that all work in concert to make sure the drone doesn&rsquo;t crash. So I crossed my fingers, hopped in the car, and headed back to the takeoff point.</p>\r\n<p>Sure enough, the Inspire 2 was there. Somehow, it had managed to fly through a dense thicket of trees and foliage &ndash;completely unassisted, mind you&ndash; and navigate back to the exact point which it had taken off from.

These emotions have been running wild since Sigma announced their new 18-35mm f/1.8 DC HSM lens. It&rsquo;s the first lens in our modern age to maintain that open of an aperture through a zoom range and it&rsquo;s also equipped with auto focus. This type of innovation has been unheard of from Sigma until recently, but now it&rsquo;s almost expected. The main question I wanted to answer about this lens was: &ldquo;Is this lens for real, or relying too heavily on the hyped, somewhat gimmicky nature of that innovation?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>As a note, most images below have been downsampled by our content management system to allow for easy and fast loading, but this does affect image quality. Please click on images below to get the full resolution with proper color and contrast.</em></p>\r\n<p>For starters, as many of your know, this is not a full frame lens. It is designed specifically for cameras with APS-C sensors, which means you can&rsquo;t fit it on your 5D MKIII or D800. I personally think that though the full frame sensors are nice, their impact and necessity are generally overstated. Are they great? Absolutely. Are you a bad photographer if you don&rsquo;t have one? That&rsquo;s absurd.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload/Chris-Gampat-The-Phoblographer-Sigma-18-35mm-f1.8-product-photos-7-of-7ISO-2001-125-sec-at-f-1_.8-680x451_1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>Once we get past the physical limitations of the lens, we can really start to appreciate its build. As I mentioned in my first look back in May, this lens is beautiful. It&rsquo;s built just like the 35mm f/1.4, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous blend of metal and rubber with only a few plastic parts. At 1.78 pounds, the lens has heft, but it&rsquo;s not what I would call heavy. It balances deftly between the two extremes of being too heavy and not feeling like it has a quality build. I hand-held the lens a lot (as opposed to using a tripod) and I have to say I never felt like it weighed too much, which was a fear given the size of the lens.</p>\r\n<p>While on that note, the lens is rather large, especially for what many of you will be used to with this focal range. It&rsquo;s a few inches longer than a comparable Canon 18-55mm or Nikon 18-35mm. The entire zoom range is internal, so it doesn&rsquo;t change sizes on you.</p>\r\n<p>Using this lens is very easy, and the autofocus works, of course, very well in daylight. It&rsquo;s fast and, generally speaking, very accurate as all the new Sigma lenses have been. In one instance (as you can see below) I had an issue with it front-focusing, but this is easily remedied with the USB Dock and Sigma software (which are very easy to use).</p>\r\n<p>At night, the lens is a bit less accurate, but it correctly focused (in nearly pure darkness) ten out of thirteen times. In a couple cases, it was just a little slow in finding a subject, by which I mean it took it about one and a half seconds instead of half a second. The performance is on par with what I have found with most good quality lenses on the market, third party or otherwise. No lens is going to hit every time in exigent circumstances, so I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied with how the Sigma did here.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload/Chris-Gampat-The-Phoblographer-Sigma-18-35mm-f1.8-product-photos-2-of-7ISO-2001-60-sec-at-f-5_.0-680x451_1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>I had a weird issue with my lens and Sigma says that they haven&rsquo;t seen this before: while in auto-focus, my camera did not beep to alert me that an image was in focus. As soon as I switched to manual focus, the camera beeped as usual. It only affected the lens while in auto-focus mode. I know many people turn the beep off to begin with, so it&rsquo;s not going to be a big deal to them. The viewfinder still flashed red when an image was in focus, I just got no auditory alert.</p>\r\n<p>I really loved the bokeh out of this lens. It\'s smooth and fluid, and makes the shallow depth of field really beautiful. Thumbs up here.</p>\r\n<p>Chromatic aberration is extremely well controlled in this lens. It was here that I was probably most impressed. In studio situations, I saw no chromatic aberration at all, even wide open. I was ready to say that there was no CA present whatsoever until the last day of testing on location when I noticed a very slight purple fringe appear around a stitched logo on one of my bags.</p>\r\n<p>This is the only time I saw any aberration, and here it is pretty inconsequential. I dare say the chroma control is better on this lens than on the 35mm f/1.4.</p>\r\n<p>Flaring is decently controlled at most apertures, though you will see some issues arise when it is most open (between f/1.8 and 3.5). Be aware of this when backlighting with particularly bright light.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Many of you might have been swayed by images posted that were taken prior to the final release of the lens. I&rsquo;m really not sure why Sigma gave the thumbs up to posting images because they 1) were not done with the final release of the lens and 2) if the images appeared soft (which they did), they could only hurt the general opinion of this lens. At best they could have looked good, but would that have made a major difference to users? I feel like it was an unnecessary risk.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I tested the sharpness of this lens in a number of situations, and found it to be pretty consistent and sharp at all focal lengths and apertures. Yes, it is most certainly sharpest between f/5.6 and f/7.1, with the best image quality at a wide angle produced at f/2.8. However, it still performs pretty well at f/1.8, just maybe not quite as good as many of us were hoping. It certainly is softer than the 35mm f/1.4, but is markedly better than any other variable focal length kit lens in this range that I have used.</p>\r\n<p>Below are a sampling of images taken at 18mm testing sharpness at f/1.8, 2.8, 5.6, 7.1, 11 and 16.</p>\r\n<p>You will notice that the 18mm images look a lot softer, and that has a lot to do with that wider focal length. We increased the angle of acceptance, therefore converging the lines of resolution, which now must fight for the few pixels that will accept their information. This equals less resolution. Below is an image where I increased the amount of space an image occupied in my frame, which gives another look at the sharpness at 18mm.</p>\r\n<p>In shooting with the lens, I found that it shows a lot of detail, but most of the super fine detail is only visible at the sweet spot apertures between f/5.6 and 7.1-8. One of the great things about the 35mm f/1.4 was the super fine detail that just seemed to pop out of the lens at any aperture. Though the 18-35mm does perform admirably, it doesn&rsquo;t really give us those amazing details that I personally am used to seeing with the top-of-the-line Sigma glass. I suspect micro ghosting is the culprit. This issue is made more complicated by the less sensitive and smaller APS-C sensor. It&rsquo;s hard for me to really be able to judge the lens on its own merits because of the limitations of the sensor.</p>\r\n<p>This situation, for me, keeps the lens under the glass ceiling that exists right above the &ldquo;prosumer&rdquo; level of equipment, and for this lens I think that&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable. It&rsquo;s not designed, I don&rsquo;t think, to be pro glass. It&rsquo;s designed to give those higher-end consumers a lens that looks great, shoots well, produces images vastly superior to competitors in the focal range and offers a uniquely wide-open aperture. For that, it easily stands out as a top contender for APS-C camera owners looking to get something far better than a kit lens at a focal range that usually screams &ldquo;beginner.&rdquo; I would recommend this lens over the Canon 18-55mm any day of the week.</p>\r\n<p>I have a hard time deciding if this focal range is useful to a lot of photographers. I certainly appreciate the variable focal length with a constant aperture, but the difference between 18 and 35mm in a lot of situations isn&rsquo;t all that much. 18mm, which translates closer to 27mm, isn&rsquo;t super wide. 35mm is great (as it translates to around 52mm), but I could already own the 35mm f/1.4 if I wanted that. It&rsquo;s just a sticky spot and though it has its uses, they are limited.</p>\r\n<p>The price point is beyond solid, coming in under $800. For this aperture, that is a feat worth applauding.</p>','g.jpg','2017-05-25 23:21:59'),
	(26,2,'open','red-weapon-8k','RED Weapon 8K','620000000',3,'<p>Last week RED announced that they would start shipping their Epic-W and Weapon cameras &ndash; both of which are fitted with the new Helium sensor. As many of you already know, Helium is an 8K Super 35mm sensor that is capable of capturing up to 75fps in full resolution on the RED Weapon.<br /><br />While I haven&rsquo;t yet had a chance to shoot with the new Weapon or Epic-W, I did download RED&rsquo;s sample footage from their website and spent some time experimenting with it in post. At some point in the future, I might do a full review of either the Epic-W or the Weapon, but for now I wanted to leave you with my first impressions after analyzing the sample shots.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload/f1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always applauded RED for their ability to push technology forward and deliver cameras that exceed the status quo in many respects. They have been a disruptive company since they first hit the scene with their RED One, and their new Helium sensor certainly furthers that legacy. There&rsquo;s a lot to love about the new sensor &ndash; namely it&rsquo;s handling of colors &ndash; but there also some caveats&nbsp;that filmmakers should be aware of when working with it.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>THE SAMPLE FOOTAGE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>I loaded the Helium sample shots into RED-CINEX PRO to see how they would play back on my system (a 12 core Mac Pro), and how grade-able they would be. Based on what I had heard previously, I was expecting there to be a lot of shadow detail in the footage, as well as improved color depth overall.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately I did feel that the Helium sensor offered a noticeable difference in color handling&nbsp;when compared to footage from RED&rsquo;s previous cameras. The skin tones on both clips felt very natural, and the images were extremely flexible&hellip; Especially with the first sample clip, which looked equally great when underexposing and overexposing the image in post.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surprisingly, even after grading the clips in RED-CINEX PRO, I was able to play them back smoothly at a 1/4 or 1/8 resolution, which I wasn&rsquo;t expecting since the 8K material is extremely high resolution.</strong> 8192 x 3456 to be exact.</p>\r\n<p>As different as the Helium sensor is from most other digital cinema sensors, it does seem to share one common trait (at least based on this test footage) &ndash; slightly overexposed footage seems to yield the best results when graded. While both clips were extremely flexible when making&nbsp;color temperature/balancing adjustments, the second clip (which was shot at ISO 800), didn&rsquo;t perform as well when I bumped up the ISO setting to 2000.</p>\r\n<p>When I pushed&nbsp;the ISO on the second sample shot, it felt like the &nbsp;some&nbsp;color information was lost, while some noise started to appear in the shadow areas. This is completely acceptable, and certainly not a knock against the sensor (as any RAW digital footage&nbsp;would likely behave in the same way)&hellip; But it&rsquo;s simply worth pointing out that this camera, like most other digital cinema cameras, may perform best when slightly exposing to the right.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload/s.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p><em>The first image below is ungraded. The second is bumped up to ISO 2000.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The detail&nbsp;present in the images is also pretty astounding. When you punch in to 100% on a 1080p monitor, you can really appreciate just how much resolution you are working with. The image below is a 1:1 crop of the original shot, exported as a PNG file.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>I found it interesting that the shot of the eye looked a bit soft when blown up to 100%.</strong> This was likely a lens issue (more than a sensor issue), as I&rsquo;m not sure how many lenses exist that can truly do justice to an 8K resolution sensor. In reality, this will never matter as most people for at least the next 10 years will be watching content&nbsp;in 4K resolution&nbsp;or below. However, I&rsquo;m sure in time more and more 8K-capable&nbsp;glass will be released that may allow this sensor to resolve even more detail.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>THE WORKFLOW</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>While my first impressions of the footage have been very positive so far, there is one big caveat to consider &ndash; the post production workflow.</strong> Unless you own a post house, or are running an extremely beefy system with access to a massive RAID/SAN solution, you are going to find that the achilles heel of 8K footage is the data management and overall post-workflow.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll re-iterate that these 8K files were surprisingly&nbsp;smooth to play back at a reduced resolution. That said, playing back footage with real time proxies is one thing, and rendering out footage for a final master is another.</p>\r\n<p>In order to experiment with some different workflow techniques, I converted the first test clip to ProRes 4444 in full 8K resolution. <strong>The export ran very slowly, even on my Mac Pro, and it ultimately resulted in&nbsp;a 3.1GB file for the 6 second video clip.</strong></p>\r\n<p>You might be thinking &ndash; <em>That doesn&rsquo;t matter because I can just edit my footage natively with real time proxies&hellip;</em> And that is true. You can certainly get away with avoiding transcoding for&nbsp;the majority of your post-production process. But eventually you will have to render out a master file. Whether you are mastering to HD or 8K, it&rsquo;s going to take a long time to transcode that footage, and depending on what system you&rsquo;re working on, there&rsquo;s a chance it might be extremely difficult to export your data master.</p>\r\n<p>I learned this the hard way when working with 4K RED One footage on my film Footsteps in 2011. I edited the film in Premiere Pro using the native .R3D files, and didn&rsquo;t realize until the last second that I was going to have a very hard time exporting my master. It took me literally dozens of attempts to finally create my data master, and ultimately I had to export the film in small chunks in order to make it work. This was especially frustrating at the time, seeing as I was&nbsp;cutting it close&nbsp;to the submission deadline of&nbsp;a festival that I nearly missed because it took so long to create the file. In 2016, exporting a 4K master is a piece of cake. In 2011, it was not &ndash; at least on my system.</p>\r\n<p>Now this may or may not be an issue for you, depending on what kind of system and software you&rsquo;re running. <strong>But it&rsquo;s certainly worth taking into account that the file sizes, and render time associated with 8K footage are going to be massive, and may cause you some serious workflow hurdles down the line. </strong>Not to mention you are going to need a huge amount of&nbsp;storage space, especially if you plan to create&nbsp;multiple back up copies of your RAW source footage<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>I truly do believe the Helium sensor is a massive&nbsp;achievement for RED, and I very much respect&nbsp;the fact that they as a company continue to push the technological side of this industry forward.</p>\r\n<p>For me personally, this is not a camera I would invest in (at any price), simply because the workflow at the moment is going to be cumbersome, and I have absolutely no need for 8K footage. That&rsquo;s not to say that this camera isn&rsquo;t going to be very valuable for certain types of productions (large scale features, green screen work, visual effects plates, etc.). However, for an independent filmmaker that needs to find the right balance between image quality and efficiency, cameras like the Arri Amira are still going to take the cake.</p>','r.jpg','2017-05-25 23:29:36'),
	(27,1,'closed','microsoft-surface-studio','Microsoft Surface Studio','35000000',2,'<p>I\'m not joking when I say the Microsoft Surface Studio makes this sentence &mdash; pulled from the incredible video that Microsoft wrote to promote its new super-luxury, all-in-one PC, in the words of Willy Wonka\'s fantasies &mdash; come true. When you get face to face with the Surface Studio, and when you see what it can do, you can\'t help but think of all the possibilities of what you can do with it. It\'s incredible.</p>\r\n<p>What Is It?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"/upload/d.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>The $4699-plus Microsoft Surface Studio is an all-in-one PC. At least at first glance. It\'s a massive 28-inch, 3:2-ratio display attached with a chrome stand to a weighty rectangle, finished in the same anodised coating that defines the look of Microsoft\'s entire Surface family, from the 12.3-inch Surface Pro 4 to the 13.5-inch Surface Book. It\'s understated, in a way &mdash; it\'s grey, for god\'s sake &mdash; but that somehow manages to make it even more striking. It\'s a monolith of computing hardware in the way that a modern iMac just isn\'t.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Then you press the top of the Surface Studio and the neck of the stand tilts. It tilts all the way from vertical to nearly horizontal, bringing the Surface Studio\'s display almost down flat to the table or desk that the PC itself is sitting upon. That\'s the Studio\'s party piece &mdash; almost its entire reason for being, if you\'re being cynical. And it\'s not neccessary, either &mdash; if you happen to own a Surface Studio, I\'m betting it\'ll spend most of its time in the read-and-type-and-browse-the-net vertical orientation. But that doesn\'t change the fact that it\'s extremely, extremely cool.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And it\'s gorgeous. For the fortnight that it was in the Gizmodo office, the Surface Studio attracted curious onlookers like bees to a particularly beautiful flower. I\'m not joking when I say that almost everyone that walked past it made some kind of comment. Plenty of the comments were \"is this an iMac?\", sure, but they were comments nonetheless, in an office where the vast majority of people &mdash; including us &mdash; don\'t take a second glance at the latest and greatest piece of technology as it comes and goes. The Surface Studio is a genuine conversation stopper. People want to come up to it, to push and pull the hinge, and to doodle away on that massive, bright, colourful 28-inch multi-touch paperlike display.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Under the hood, the Microsoft Surface Studio doesn\'t stand out from the crowd of other all-in-one PCs and laptops that it\'s competing with, even though that\'s not really its key selling point. You\'ll get yourself either a Core i5 or Core i7 CPU, anywhere between 8GB and 32GB of RAM, a 1TB or 2TB hybrid hard drive, and graphics by Nvidia &mdash; a GeForce GTX 965M or 980M mobile GPU which gives a massive dedicated bump to performance when it comes to video editing, 3D rendering or any other graphically-intensive app. Considering that the Surface Studio is ostensibly aimed at artists and creatives, that last part is a welcome and neccessary inclusion.</p>\r\n<p>What\'s It Good At?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Everything about the Surface Studio\'s design is incredible. Everything. The hinge is a work of art. How it looks in Microsoft\'s demo video is exactly how it operates. You place one finger gently against the top of the 28-inch display\'s bezel and push, just slightly, and that screen moves from the vertical orientation you\'re familiar with all the way down to a drafting table\'s wrist-friendly angle that you\'re almost certainly not familiar with. An equally gentle tug with a crooked finger returns it to desktop mode. It\'s effortless, and that lack of effort is testament to the stunning industrial design and engineering that has gone into creating the Surface Studio.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When it\'s in drafting mode, the entire point of the Surface Studio changes. Dramatically. It goes from being a single-user all-in-one PC &mdash; one of relatively limited and pedestrian use, as beautiful as it looks &mdash; to a much more complex piece of technology. It becomes a collaboration tool that you can share content with and around and from. It becomes an artist\'s canvas. Even if you\'re not an artist. You can still use keyboard and mouse, but it\'s so much more tempting to use the touchscreen, to scroll by swiping and to type on the on-screen keyboard. This is what touchscreen all-in-one PCs should have been all along.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Surface Dial is a fascinating piece of input hardware. On the surface &mdash; pardon the pun &mdash; it\'s so simple; it\'s just a dial. A dial that you can click. A dial that you can click and hold. A dial that you can click and hold and place on the screen and see a live graphical representation of exactly what you\'re changing and what options you\'re flicking between. For art &mdash; drawing with different brushes, different sizes and opacities, it\'s a godsend. It does with a twist what would have required hotkey presses and trips to contextual menus. It makes art understandable and accessible to a Luddite like me that barely understands stick figures. The Dial doesn\'t come with the Studio, but you\'d be insane not to buy one.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And, just like every other Surface device review before it, I would be remiss to not mention the Surface Studio\'s display. Microsoft puts an amazing amount of effort into calibrating its panels and making them every bit as good as they possibly can be, and the same is true of the Studio. Its 4500x3000pixel resolution is phenomenally crisp, and spoils any 4K video shown on it even without the crutch of HDR that today\'s best 4K TVs have. Its colours are incredibly bright and vivid without being oversaturated. It\'s touch sensitive. It\'s probably the best computer display I\'ve ever seen and used.</p>\r\n<p>What\'s It Not Good At?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There\'s no getting around the fact that the Surface Studio is expensive. Very expensive. In the same vein as the Surface Book, you\'ll pay a premium for that small extra level of utility over a comparable competitor\'s product. The iMac tilts, sure &mdash; but you want the Studio\'s almost-flat drafting table hinge, that\'s gonna cost you extra. The cheapest Surface Studio that you can buy is $4699, and that\'s the kind of price that\'ll see it probably generally restricted to the desks of C-suites and executives around Australia. I worry that it might be priced outside the reach of all but the most dedicated and already-commercially-successful graphic artists.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"/upload/w.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>And at the end of the day, you have to remember that Microsoft\'s thin, svelte Surface Studio is effectively a powerful laptop. It has a CPU from Intel\'s Skylake range, but a mobility-focused i5-6440HQ or i7-6820HQ that trades pure clock speed for a much-reduced thermal footprint. Its RAM options are not user upgradeable, as are its SSD-plus-spinning-disk 1TB and 2TB storage options, so you\'d better be happy with whichever spec you settle for when you click that purchase button for the first and final time. On that note, the price bump to the top Surface Studio is pretty severe &mdash; you\'re paying an extra $1900 on top of the Studio\'s already painfully high price to get that top-spec graphics card and storage and RAM.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One more minor complaint about the Surface Studio\'s hardware spec &mdash; like the Surface Book that I love despite its foibles, the Surface Studio is still only running Nvidia\'s 9-series mobile graphics chipsets, the 2GB GeForce GTX 965M and 4GB GTX 980M. Both are efficient, relatively powerful laptop graphics chipsets, but Microsoft would have done well to hold off the Surface Studio to integrate the graphics maker\'s 10-Series laptop chips, which are just as powerful as desktop cards and are a quantum leap in efficiency and processing power versus the now-outdated 9-Series. The Surface Studio can still handle modern games, just not at its massively high 4500x3000pixel native resolution. It might have been able with a newer GPU inside.</p>\r\n<p>Should You Buy It?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I can\'t recommend that you actually go out and buy the Microsoft Surface Studio. At $4699, it\'s very expensive &mdash; for an all-in-one PC and for a PC at all, even considering its heavy emphasis on design and screen and touch interaction over outright computing power. The cheapest iMac for comparison is $1699, and the most expensive is $3599 &mdash; a full thousand dollar saving over even the cheapest Surface Studio. Comparing the two is apples to oranges, but the iMac is the closest parallel to the unique Surface Studio that exists at the moment. So you\'re paying for the privilege of the Studio\'s design and innovation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The appeal of the Surface Studio, at least on paper, is that it\'s made for artists and graphic designers to do beautiful work on. I\'m not either, but that didn\'t stop me trying &mdash; and I really feel like the scribbles and drawings that I made flattered my skill level as an artist. When you have such a big, detailed, hyper-crisp display and the combination of tactile, hyper-sensitive input from the Surface Pen and the Surface Dial, it\'s hard not to make art. Everything that you do with the Surface Studio as a creator &mdash; even if it\'s just these words &mdash; feels special. It\'s so strange to say, but I really did fall in love with the Surface Studio in my weeks with it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But all these things considered, the Surface Studio is hands down the most incredible piece of technology I have interacted with in all my time in this job. The screen is amazing. The Surface Dial is a revelation. And the hinge &mdash; my god, the hinge. It\'s a perfectly powerful computer for anything you could want it to do, for anyone but the most demanding user &mdash; who wouldn\'t consider it anyway. But it\'s not just about power, it\'s about a user-focused combination of design and versatility and new interfaces; the Surface Studio has all three in spades.</p>','c.jpg','2017-05-25 23:38:05'),

Model S comes with Autopilot capabilities designed to make your highway driving not only safer, but stress free.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\"><img src=\"https://www.tesla.com/tesla_theme/assets/img/shared-features/features--adaptive-headlights.png\" alt=\"\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n<h4>Adaptive Lighting</h4>\r\n<p>Model S now features full LED adaptive headlamps. Besides enhancing the already great styling, they also boost safety: 14 three-position LED dynamic turning lights improve visibility at night, especially on winding roads.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\"><img src=\"https://www.tesla.com/tesla_theme/assets/img/shared-features/features--hepa-filter.png\" alt=\"\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n<h4>Bio-Weapon Defense Mode</h4>\r\n<p>Model S now features a Medical grade HEPA air filtration system, which removes at least 99.97% of particulate exhaust pollution and effectively all allergens, bacteria and other contaminants from cabin air. The bioweapon defense mode creates positive pressure inside the cabin to protect occupants.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tesla.com/tesla_theme/assets/img/models/slideshow/Red_Profile-1297.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>The Model S P100D with Ludicrous mode is the third fastest accelerating production car ever produced, with a 0-60 mph time of 2.5*&nbsp;seconds. However, both the LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder were limited run, million dollar vehicles and cannot be bought new. While those cars are small two seaters with very little luggage space, the pure electric, all-wheel drive Model S P100D has four doors, seats up to 5 adults plus 2 children and has exceptional cargo capacity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img src=\"/upload/hero-01-LHD.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n<p>The 100 kWh battery also increases range substantially to an estimated 315 miles on the EPA cycle and 613 km on the NEDC cycle, making it the first to go beyond 300 miles and the longest range production electric vehicle by far.</p>\r\n<p>The larger battery pack is also available on the Model X, making the world&rsquo;s quickest SUV even faster. Model X P100D with Ludicrous mode accelerates to 60 mph in 2.9* seconds and travels up to 289 miles EPA estimated and 542 km on the NEDC cycle on a single charge. Model X is also a pure electric SUV and can seat up to seven adults.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n<p>Model S and Model X are engineered to be the safest cars on the road and to have the highest ratings from NHTSA. Both have access to the Tesla Supercharger network for the freedom to travel long distance for free. And every Tesla will improve over time with free over the air upgrades.</p>\r\n<p>Tesla customers who have ordered a P90D Ludicrous, but not taken delivery, can upgrade to the 100 kWh pack for $10,000. Existing P90D Ludicrous owners can also upgrade to a 100 kWh pack, but for $20,000, as their used 90 kWh pack will have to be recycled.</p>\r\n<p>While the P100D Ludicrous is obviously an expensive vehicle, we want to emphasize that every sale helps pay for the smaller and much more affordable Tesla Model 3 that is in development. Without customers willing to buy the expensive Model S and X, we would be unable to fund the smaller, more affordable Model 3 development.</p>\r\n</div>','p100d-announcement.jpg','2017-05-25 01:03:45');
